This is the new version of the maze project created 6/18/17.

The changes made include adding a node class, Node and linked list class, LLCreate. 

I also created a linked list in the main class, and copied the information gotten from the input file to this linked list. I then had it print all of the nodes in the console screen. I was unable to successfully find a way to print all of these on the specified lines, even after hours of searching online for a solution. I have it printing the nodes in the console in a line. These cannot be changed to write on one line, as it uses \n to create the string in the square class. 

In hindsight changing the way the string was created would have been beneficial for printing on a single line for a certain amount of nodes. It wasn't that difficult to copy the array to the linked list, and I was happy with this implementation.
